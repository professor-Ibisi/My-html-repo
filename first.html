  <h1><strong>Brief history of git</strong></h1>
  <img src="image/github.jpeg" width="140" height="100" alt=" a pic of github">
  <p> <a href="second.html">second</a> As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction
    and fiery controversy.<br>
    The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope.<br>
    For most of the lifetime of the <strong>kernel</strong> maintenance (1991–2002),<br>
    changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files.<br>
    In 2002, the <strong>Linux</strong>kernel project began using a proprietary version control software called
    BitKeeper.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="color: brown;">In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the
    commercial<br>
    company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked.<br>
    This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds,<br>
    the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using
    BitKeeper.<br>
    Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities.<br>
    It’s incredibly fast, it’s very efficient with large projects,<br>it has an incredible branching system for
    non-linear development.</br>
